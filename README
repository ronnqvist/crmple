Project is still only half done. But will soon be a working very simple CRM. You're free to use it, and very welcome extend it to your needs. Please contribute your code if you do! We haven't decided on a license yet but it'll probably be something between MIT and GPL3. :)

Please note that the CSS-code is only here for demo purposes, and is not allowed to be used by third parties deploying this code for production use! This may be a subject to change, but for the time being we want to keep the look 'n feel to ourselves.
